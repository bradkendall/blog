**Artem Kotelskiy**

안녕하세요.

나는 obelisk 합의 알고리즘에 관한 두 논문이 실수 때문에 arxiv에서 철회된 것을 알게되었습니다. 이것은 사실입니까?

팀의 누군가가 이 문제를 해결할 수 있습니까?

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

음, obelisk에 대해서요? 우리는 기본적인 로직에 대해 적어도 5 개 이상의 논문을 가지고 있지만, 이전에 obelisk에 대해 
특별히 공개된 것이 있는지는 모르겠군요.

어떤 논문이 제외되었나요?

**Synth** *[Artem Kotelskiy에게 답글]*

아뇨. Chen은 사람들이 arxiv 대신에 더 권위있다고 여겨지는 ACM 저널을 통해 그것을 접하기를 
원했기 때문에 그것들을 철회하였습니다.

**Synth**

그리고 Chen은 논문 중 하나가 적절하지 않은 사소한 오류가 있기 때문에 그것이 철회되어야 한다고 생각합니다.

이 논문의 알고리즘은 단지 제 3세대 합의 알고리즘이며, 우리의 것은 5세대이고 백서를 제작할 필요가 있습니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03927

이것은 결정적인 이론적 결함을 보여줍니다.

**Synth**

이것은 Chen을 바보로 만들었습니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

다양한 논문의 견해와 같습니다.

**Synth**

그가 발표하기 몇달 전에 내가 그에게 말한 것과 같은 오류가 한 논문에 있었습니다.

**Synth**

그러나 이것은 관련성이 없습니다. 아이디어는 에너지 최소화 기법을 기반으로하며 통계 물리학에서 시작하였습니다.

Chen은 작동하지 않는 이상한 해싱으로 전체 작업을 시도하고 있습니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

그래서 웹사이트 상의 논문은 arxiv의 논문과 다릅니까?

저는 정말이지 arxiv 상의 코멘트를 좋아하지 않아요. 논문 저자는 그것을 거부했고, 그것은 뭔가 이상합니다.

**Synth**

그것은 8개 버전이 있습니다.

최종 버전은 ACM 저널/컨퍼런스에 게시된 것입니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

링크를 알려주시겠어요?

구글에서 찾을 수 없네요.

**Synth** *[Artem Kotelskiy에게 답글]*

Chen 교수. 그 공동 저자는 이 논문을 발표하지 않기를 원합니다. 
그는 블록 체인을 이해하지 못하며, 중국 정부가 블록 체인(blockchain)에 대해 공격하고 있다고 생각하고 
이 논문이 그를 곤경에 빠뜨릴 수도 있다고 생각합니다.

**Synth**

**Artem Kotelskiy** *[Synth에게 답글]*

나는 이것이 어떤 방식이든 간에 당신의 웹사이트에서 해결되어야 한다고 생각합니다. 
전체 프로젝트는 obelisk의 보안을 기반으로합니다. 
이 알고리즘이 적어도 CS 사람들에 의해 동료 평가를 받았음을 사람들에게 분명히 밝혀야합니다.

이것은 단순한 이유입니다. -- CS를 제외한 아무도 그 논문에 집중하지 않고, 그것이 옳은지 확인하지 않습니다.

**Synth** *[Artem Kotelskiy에게 답글]*

적절한 실행 및 세부사항에 대한 40 ~ 60페이지의 6번째 백서가 만들어 질 것입니다. 그러나 아무도 그것을 쓸 시간이 없습니다.

우리는 시뮬레이션을 완료하였고, 이제 피어 검색이 작동하여 1세대를 구현하고 실 생활에서 그것을 실행할 것입니다.

**Synth** *[Artem Kotelskiy에게 답글]*

그는 Go 이더리움을 구현한 사람들 중 한명입니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Jiwu?

이것은 또한 웹 사이트에 있어야합니다. 어쨋건 간에, 많은 답변을 주셔서 감사합니다.

**Synth**

이 논문은 분산 데이터베이스 합의를 위한 ACM 컴포터 과학 저널 및 컨퍼런스에서 상위 2위에 랭크되었으며, 동료 검토를 거쳤습니다.

우리는 단지 동료 검토를 거친 논문과 시뮬레이션을 통해서만 코인을 만듭니다. 

**Synth**

Chen

**Artem Kotelskiy**

그것에 대해 몰랐습니다.

그리고 구글에서 이더리움에 대한 그의 업적을 찾을 수 없네요.

링크를 알려주세요.

**Synth**

우리는 그것을 웹사이트에 게시할 수 없습니다. 왜냐하면 Chen이 그러지 말라고 요청했거든요. 
스카이코인에 관련된 80%의 사람들은 웹사이트나 고문단에 그들이 공개되는 것을 원하지 않습니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

네, 그것은 또 다른 문제죠.

알겠습니다.

왜죠???

**Synth**

두 가지 이유입니다. 중국의 잠재적인 비트코인 금지 또는 공포심 조장 때문에, 그리고 미국의 세금 또는 고용 상의 이유 때문입니다.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

이것은 매우 비관적이군요.))

왜 당신들은 스위스로 가지 않나요?

사실, 저는 Chen을 이더리움 팀에서 찾았습니다.

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

모든 코인 중에서 우리가 가지고 있는 레파지토리, 히스토리, 백서와 모든 것을 갖추고 있는 코인은 매우 적습니다. 
그리고 우리는 우리의 웹사이트에 쓸모없는 얼굴과 이름을 게시하지 않기때문에 이러한 그늘을 만들었습니다. 😂

**Synth**

그의 공개키는 이더리움 개발자의 레포에 있습니다. 그의 github를 확인하십시오.

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

In my opinion it's shady to collection 10's if not 100's of millions through ICO's without one line of code to show for it

**Synth**

The bitcoin developer who discovered the duplicate coinbase output problem also was heavily involved and two other major people but we cant put them on the website or advisor board.

There is a lot of drama about this.

Australian government was raiding peoples houses within 8 hours of them being outed as early bitcoin dev etc

And a lot of the real crypto people have security clearances and dont want to be publicly associated (but are involved in private) because of employment stuff

**Artem Kotelskiy** *[In reply to Monty Crypto (Xa no)]*

I was just kidding, see the "))"

**Synth**

The only people commiting with their real github names were basicly idiots with no opsec. And the other people involved dont sit on advisor boards or advertise themselves.

I dont even know why chen used his main/public github account. He was advised not to do that.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I see, thx a lot for an explanation

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

Haha fair enough 👍

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I will keep doing my research then about skycoin

There is one problem though, all of this will come out inevitably..

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

+8 years of drama. You could make a movie about this.

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

No. it wont. People still cannot even figure out who the Bitcoin devs are!

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Hopefully

Still, why not go to Switzerland?

And have superopen development just like ethereum?

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

For what?

eighty people should move to switzerland?

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Ok..

I mean, the organization can go there and be protected somehow

**Synth**

Its on github so does not matter the country they are in.

Protected from what? No one has tried to attack skycoin devs yet.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

But you are saying that people are scared to say they are involved with the project

I just don't understand why?

**Synth**

for tax reasons

**Artem Kotelskiy**

No

Can't believe this

Why don't you want to pay taxes?

**Vadim 🛌**

why would anyone want:D

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

Lol, yeah everyone else loves paying taxes

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I don't see how rejecting to pay taxes can help your project at all

Please explain

**Monty Crypto (Xa no)**

There's a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance

Tax avoidance is perfectly legal and executed by every single corporation in the world

**Synth**

Imagine you have 800 million in bitcoin. Do you run down the street bragging about it?

Do people with security cleanances and NDA agreements go around putting faces on websites? These people do not even have Facebook accounts and NDA says they cannot tell their clients who their other clients are.

Also there are IP issues with employers. If someone works at company the contract says the company owns everything they do. Including work in free time.

So they cannot contribute code publicly or company/employer can claim ownership and IP and causes legal problems.

There is a whole bunch of drama and bullshit. Anyone competent is secretive. And the people promoting themselves in public are losers.

ALL of the early bitcoin people expected the US government to crack down in it VIOLENTLY. And that fear never went away.

The people entering crypto today do not remember the crypto wars and government oppression of the 90s

**Vadim 🛌**

i find it strange that people are surprised by the anonymity of those interested in cryptography

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I don't like ndas

I would think competent people never sign nda

Apparently I am wrong

Contracts with the companies...

Eh

So your devs and researchers are worried about their money, and you (presumably along with other projects of your scale) are imposing on them rules. Hard to believe.

**Synth** *[In reply to Vadim 🛌]*

What a world.

And they forget that ALL of the professional math and crypto people either work for the government or military.

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

Everyone who works at Google or a Fortune 500. We have commits from people who work for Google/Amazon if you look at commit history.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

The only thing I believe professional researcher is worried about is security.

Yeah, I don't think google/Amazon are such great companies frankly

Although people there are competent

Anyway

I got your point

About all professional math people you stretched too far. I know exactly what kind of people leave pure math and go to military, and they are not the best, believe me.

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

Like Google.

Almost all large companies gave contract that says "we own you. You are our slave. We own everything you do in your free time".

That is ALL fortune 500 companies. You will notice that they stopped commiting after taking employment at those companies.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I see...

Sad

**Synth**

also the way US works is that information / research can still be classified after being published into the public domain.

So if a person gets government grant or worked on source routing or something and it is published, but that technology is used on later project they are associated with then it does not absolve them of legal liability

and if they worked at university while the algorithms were developed the university can make IP claim

so everyone in the US lives terrorized by lawyers

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I see. Hard to believe there are Universities in USA who would file such ip

But I still stand by my point

I think on your homepage you should explain why devs are hidden

**Synth**

You mean like Stanford/Cisco/Googler etc

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Ah, but then this will attract attention

**Artem Kotelskiy** *[In reply to Synth]*

Could you link or give keywords for any ip case there?

Google and Cisco are companies

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

They are not hidden. People are just too stupid to check github.

Skycoin is not about bragging about who has the biggest developer dick on their advisor board.

The website is about the coin and the technology. We dont believe in the advisor board, celebrity CEO dick measuring contest.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Lol, account on github also doesn't add anything, although I admit that there are accounts there which have other social media

You know, I don't advice you to advertise yourself

Not at all

In fact I hate all these bright "team" pages and stuff

But here is one simple thing

I like the project

The future of the project is in hands of developers completely

So it would help if I know who they are, and what are their values

For me to decide, if I am going to be the sky node, or simply sky hodler

But I get it, you think that code and execution speaks to itself, fair enough

**Synth**

You go dox yourself and report all your stuff to the government and go pay your taxes to the central bank that owns you. All human cattle, please line up for bar coding.

Its the exact opposite of why bitcoin was created.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Yeah well, there are different degrees of being crypto anarchist

**Vadim 🛌**

being one in words and in reality?:D

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I tend to believe that declaring a war to the previous governors doesn't help pieceful transitioning to a better system.

I might be wrong, guys, so don't push

Just an opinion :)

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

The central bank creates money out of nothing. Then the government taxes the money back from the slaves.

You are either a slave or you are free. People working for other peoples money, are not working for themselves. They are slaving for for their master/owner.

There is no degrees. You are either owned and are a slave and have a slave tracking number and live under a massive surveilence, police state central bank run slave plantation OR you are free. Slave or Free. There is no degrees.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

I see. I think the next thing to discuss is if the government is good or not (let's say US). And I know I will lose this one, so let's not go into this. I completely understand your pov. It differs from mine in that I believe in kindness more, and think that there is a spectrum of freedom. But could be I am just young and inexperienced.

**Synth**

"Freedom to masturbate to porn", "freedom to smoke marijuana", "freedom to have anal sex", "freedom to shoot up heroin", "freedom to run around in the 'free market' laboring like a slave for someone elses money", "freedom to shop!".

Slavery is not about free or slave. Its about independent (free) or dependent (slave).

You make people dependent upon you for survival, then you give them fake "freedoms" so they dont revolt. That is how you turn a society into a labor camp and then give them enough free porn, prozac and zoloft until you have domesticated "happy slaves" that cannot even imagine what an alternative would look like.

Look how free those people are with their $750,000 in student debt they wont pay off until they die! Lol. Its just a mockery.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Everyone makes his own choices

Some people just grow food and live off that

I am from the country where half of the population lives like this, it's just fine

And I think if one really wants, he can be free

**Vadim 🛌**

let me guess, belarus?

**Artem Kotelskiy**

No, it's harder to guess

**Synth**

Anyone who does not want to be a slave is an anarchist now! Lol

"Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I dont want to be an anararchist. I mean a little slavery is ok, but the masters should be nicer to the slaves." Lol.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Anarchist is someone who declares a war on the government

Loool

**Synth**

Anarchist.

An-archon

An means without.

Archon means "master" or "ruler".

Anarchy means "without masters" or without rulers. All of the words are inverted to mock the public and the illiterate.

**Artem Kotelskiy**

Anyway

Keep up the skycoin guys, I sincerely hope it will allow more people not to have masters

**Artem Kotelskiy** *[In reply to Synth]*

Ok

**Synth**

Lol

matthieu *[In reply to Synth]*

👍🏾agree completely

**Synth** *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

No. The problem is human nature.

You cannot free slaves. They will just find another master. They *want* and choose to be slaves. They just want a slave driver with a softer whip.

Look at how people spontaniously elect leaders to tell them what to do and tell them how they should live and what they should fear. Because they refuse to do it themselves.

matthieu *[In reply to Artem Kotelskiy]*

Actually maybe it would serve the coin more to put forward the ideology behind as synth put it rather than having a few faces....

matthieu

Synth So far I didn't know what were your motivations/values and  deep ideology. Now I am an even bigger supporter of the coin. This is important to remind the final aim of all of this... Loads of ppl forget and just want to be overnight millionaires by buying into ICOs...

**Synth** *[In reply to matthieu]*

Trillionaires lol. Worlds first trillionaires. Briefly until this bubble bursts.

Millionaire is so 1994

matthieu

😂😂

**Synth**

Bitcoin gets pushed up to $5000 but if even 1% of holders sold it would be back at $2000. So very high price increase vs the market depth.

I think we could see trillionaires or people worth more than Billgates briefly, before they start moving money out and it implodes.

Altcoins, unlike real estate and stocks, have no price ceiling. There is no fundamental economics or mathematics keeping the price from going up to infinity.

There is no revenues or loss and no objective way to determine that a buggy "smart contract" platform no one uses, should not be worth $250 billion dollars.
