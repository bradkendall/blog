## Q&A

>백서의 재-작업에 대한 언급은 없습니다.
>이것은 당신의 마케팅이 참조 자료를 가지고 시작하도록 하기 위한 우선순위가 아니어야 합니다.
>이것은 기술적인 코인이므로 문서를 최신 상태로 유지할 필요가 있습니다.

모두가 너무 바쁩니다.

우리는 기술적인 기고가를 확보하기 위해 노력하고 있으며, 
단지 컨텐츠와 기사를 인포-그래픽스로 작업하고 있습니다.

>코인을 단지 소수점 한 자리수로 바꾸는 이유가 무엇입니까?
>다른 모든 코인에는 6 ~ 8 개의 소수점이 있습니다.

소수 자릿수 1 자리는 ~ 0.30 달러를 의미합니다.

스카이코인이 10 달러에 도달하면 소수점 2 자리를 사용합니다. 우리는 결국 총 6 자릿수을 사용할 수 있습니다.

우리는 단지 사람들이 나노-거래를 남발하고 블록체인을 쓰레기로 채우지 않기를 바랍니다. 

>텔레그램과 슬렉 채널을 홍보하는 것이 어떻습니까? 
>discord로 완전히 이동하십시오.

Discord에는 아무도 없습니다. 우리는 슬렉을 더 많이 사용하지 않습니다.

우리에게는 스카이-메신저와 자체 메시징 플랫폼이 있으므로 궁극적으로 그 곳으로 이동할 것입니다.

우리는 또한 BBS와 우리 자신의 소셜 미디어 플랫폼을 가지고 있습니다.

>또한 텔레그램이 잘못 설정되었습니다. 어떤 사람들은 슬렉의 뉴스에 접근할 수 
있지만 BB와 메인 슬렉에는 접근할 수 없습니다.

텔레그램은 스팸 때문에 슈퍼-채널에서 비-영어권 국가 번호/사용자가 
영어로 대화하는 것을 금지합니다. 
구글 음성 번호를 얻고 사용하면 작동합니다.

>제 의견으로는 알트 및 BTC 및 그들의 가족들이 어쩌면 시장에서 다시 호황을 누릴 것입니다.

예. 반드시.

저는 거의 10 억 달러에 거래되는, 사용자가 없는 쓰레기 플랫폼을 보고 있습니다.

비트코인은 3 월에 1만 달러를 기록 할 것입니다.

## 현재 비트코인 시장 요약

이것은 내부 트랙에서 발생되었으며, 우리가 최근에 토론한 것입니다.... 

우리는 마케팅이 위아래로 진행되면서 약간의 기복을 볼 것입니다.
하지만 자산 볼륨과 암호 자산으로의 관심 집중은 계속해서 증가하고 있습니다.

그러나 실제 또는 합법적인 코인은 매우 적습니다. There are lot of coins
매우 멋진 웹 사이트를 가진 코인들이 많이 있으며, 많은 코인들이 멋져 보이는 
"조언자 기구"를 가지고 있습니다.
ICO 전후로 수억 달러를 모으는 동전들이 있습니다.

그러나, 이러한 코인 거의 대부분이 어떤 소프트웨어 개발자도 없으며, 
소프트웨어 개발자를 고용하거나 관리할 능력이 없거나 
소프트웨어를 설계하거나 디자인할 능력이 없습니다.

그러나, 그들의 마케팅은 매우 좋습니다. 개발자는 소프트웨어 개발을 할 필요가 
없으므로 사물을 개발하는 대신 마케팅에 100 % 집중할 수 있습니다. 
실제로 실제 일을 하는 프로젝트는 이 시장에서 장애를 가지며 무시됩니다.

엄청난 돈을 벌어들인, 개발자가 없는 프로젝트 중 일부는, "그들의 AI가 완료될" 때까지, 
오픈 소스를 공개하지 않을 것이라고 발표합니다. 
(그들이 소프트웨어를 개발하는지에 대해 아무도 알 수가 없습니다.) 
그래서 그들은 몇 가지 종류의 인공 지능 머신 러닝(LOL, what!?)을 만들었습니다. 
그들이 실제로 코드를 작성하는지 또는 시스템이 어떻게 작동하는지에 대해 누군가가 알기 전에 말입니다.

실제 프로젝트가 거의 없기 때문에, 소수의 실제 프로젝트에 엄청난 양의 자금이 빠르게 쏟아질 것입니다.

이 프로젝트에 투자할 시간, 누구도 신경 쓰지 않고 코인을 얻는 시간은 매우 짧습니다.

예전에는, 사람들이 코인을 평가하기 전에 저렴한 가격에 구입할 수 있는 기간이 있었습니다. 
이것은 몇 년이 걸렸습니다. (라이트코인과 비트코인 같은)

그 다음 바이트볼과 같은 최신 코인의 경우 불과 몇 달 만에 페니에서 $800로 
가격이 폭등했기 때문에 구매하는데 불과 몇 개월 밖에 걸리지 않았습니다. 
이제 관심의 속도는 더욱 빨라지고 더욱 경쟁적인 시간대에 있습니다.

이제 카르다노(Cardano)와 같은 프로젝트에서 모든 코인은 내부자에게 미리 판매됩니다. 
그 다음 코인은 마술처럼 톱15에 갑자기 나타납니다. 
코인이 사용자 커뮤니티에 의해 매매되는 기간은 없습니다. 
그들은 코인을 내부자, VC 및 이미 부유한 사람들에게 팔 뿐입니다. 
그런 다음 코인의 POPS를 거래소에 전액 지불한 다음, 
마케팅 담당자에게 비용을 지불하여 사람들이 구매하도록 홍보합니다. 
내부자들은 가능한 한 많은 코인을 처분합니다.

전에는 대중이 좋은 코인을 찾아서, 그것이 오르기 전에 싼 가격으로 살 수 있는 시기가 있었습니다. 
오늘날에, 그것은 단지 이미 부유한 내부자들의 담합일 뿐이며, 
거래소에서 대중들에게 대량으로 던지기 전에 각각 다른 코인을 주거나
(pre-ICO, lol 무엇인가?) 기관 판매를 하는 것입니다. 

따라서 새로운 모델은 다음과 같습니다.:

- 창업자와 내부자는 ICO 가격의 1/10로 구매합니다.
- 그들은 대중에게 ICO 가격으로 판매합니다. 
  ("pre-ICO"에서의 내부 가격의 10배로 누구도 당신에게 이것에 대해 말하지 않았습니다.)
- 그 다음 pre-ICO/ICO 판매 시의 ICO 가격 및 할인 가격으로 코인을 거래소에 
  대량으로 내놓고 프로젝트를 엉망으로 만드십시오.
  가능한 많은 코인을 멍청한 대중에게 던지십시오.
- 조언자 기구에 있는 모든 사람들이 이것을 +20개의 코인에서 하고 있습니다.
  일부 사람들은 단지 ICO를 하고, 다음 코인으로 가서 세탁/반복을 매주 진행합니다.

대부분의 "ICO에서 1억 5천만 달러를 모았습니다!"는 가짜입니다. 
그것의 5명의 녀석은 돈을 가지고 코인에 넣고 돈을 백엔드로 돌려놓습니다.

"투자자"는 매우 광범위하며 큰 할인(코인의 상당 퍼센트에 대한 매우 큰 할인)을 요구합니다. 
"다른 코인들은 모두 시장 가격의 30%를 제게 주고 있습니다." 
"코인 투자금"이 생겨나고 주변을 돌아다니며 5,000만 달러짜리 
암호 코인 뭉치를 사려고 합니다. 
시장가격에 비해 5% 또는 20%의 암호-화폐를 더 받을 수 있기 때문에, 
그들은 이익을 위해 시간이 지남에 따라 대량 매도를 할 수 있습니다.   

이전 모델은 다음과 같습니다.:

- 당신은 코인을 발표합니다.
- 사용자 커뮤니티와 인지도가 커짐에 따라 점차적으로 가치가 상승합니다.
- 초기 사람들은 잘 해왔으며 프로젝트는 뭔가 유용한 일을 합니다.

현재의 모델은 단지 대중적인 스캠으로 당신은 무엇도 얻을 수 없습니다.

I think, from experience with some of the coins I have advised on, from some
of the conference calls I have been on, that I can predict that we could see
some exchange owners raided at gun point and thrown face down with a gun to
their head while their servers are looted and confiscated by the government.
Not because their are scamming people, but just because they are clueless and
snubbing the wrong person or the friend of the regulators.

Basically, none of the governments wanted to "regulate" Bitcoin or the exchanges
until the "regulator" and their friends started getting into the market and
wanted to push out the other people. In the United States especially, you will
have an oligarchy like CoinBase and a few companies and only they are allowed
to operate. They will start white listing coins, so only their coins
get listed and exchanges will be delisting the other projects.

The exchanges that are not owned by the right people are going to be shutdown
(or hacked).

They are literally doing "Do what we say and we will protect you", then on
backend they are trying to get them shutdown at gunpoint so they can put their
"licensed" competitor in place. Sort of like Circle trying to integrate
Bitcoin into iMessage, then creating a white-list of which coins could go into
the Apple App store. Everyone is trying to figure out how they can grab this
thing and get control over it.

Just imagine if Apple integrated circle as the "official Bitcoin wallet" and
put it in iMessenger, then purged all the Bitcoin wallets from the App store.

The coin market is forming into an oligarchy. People are demanding "regulation"
because they are scamming everyone left and right and do not want to compete
with other people's scams so they want to own and control the regulation and
shut everyone else down. That is what is happening.

I think we may see another round of large hacks, like we did on Gox.

There may not be a regulatory or legal pretense for shutting down particular
exchanges (like what happened to BTC-E) and they could be "hacked" and cleared
out like MtGox.

There was also a conference call where it was pointed out that the SEC was
funded by regulatory actions, fines and asset seizures. That is where their
budget comes from.

- The exchanges are ranked by volume.
- Exchanges with no fees can create infinite fake volume, so only the
  exchanges with trading fees are included in ranking, otherwise it's
  inaccurate
- To pump up their volumes and stay in the top of the rankings, the
  exchanges are doing secret rebates of trading fees and other scams to
  inflate their volume, while the actual volume is much lower
- The exchanges that are most aggressive about puffing their volume and who
  are least moral are highest ranked
- There is a huge incentive for exchanges to lie and puff their volume (which
  is why they are only listing scam coins, who can guarantee high volumes and
  fees)

Exchanges will not list a coin unless they are guanteed to make a minimum of
$5,000 or $40,000 a day in trading fees. So the coin has to be heavily marketed
to scalp that much money off the user community after the ICO. The exchanges
are taking 0.1% on each side (0.2% per trade because they are trading against
themselves). So every million dollars a day of volume is draining a coin $2,000
/day in exchange fees. Some of the coins are doing $6 or $10 million/day in
"paid volume" or "guaranteed volume" ($12,000 or $20,000 a day in volume for
medium sized coin). The exchange owners only care about volume.

The scam coins and mega-ICOs are paying the fees and working with the "market
makers" to create the fake volume so the exchange owners know how much money
they will make.

Kraken is probably the only exchange that no one complains about and is not
screwing with the volume.

Most people with large orders are actually trading OTC on Bitfinex or other
OTC platforms.

Most of the exchanges are making their money on volume and do not
have maker/taker fees so there is no real order book depth. Making it very
easy to rig and manipulate coin prices with a relatively small amount of money
(hence OTC must be used to fill large orders because they cannot be done on
the order book). The market structure is just broken and optimized for
manipulation.

- No maker/taker fees, so a thin order book depth
- Exchanges making all of their fees on volume
- Exchanges ranked by fake volume (and exchanges are faking volume)
- Hidden trading rebates
- Paid market makers (people paid massive fees to create fake volume)
- Inaccurate exchange rankings (by fake volume)
- Inability to buy/sell on market (thus a need for OTC)
- Most coins are off markets because of the hacking risk (getting Goxed)
- Ability to easily rig billions in coin market cap with little money
  because there is no real order book depth
- Emphasis of exchanges on only the largest, most well marketed coins who have
  done huge ICOs (all of which are scams). No emphasis on technology or real
  companies

So for concrete example and instance there are three micro-grid tokens and
companies:

- One is launching token and is a 100 million/year existing business who has
  been building and operating combined heating/electricity generation for
  thirty years. Has whole legal department to deal with regulation and
  customer pricing laws and compliance. Has existing customers and revenue.
- The other two coins are are massive ICOs that raised tens or hundreds of
  millions of dollars, but have no software, no employees, no experience
  building power grids and do not even understand the regulations required
  to operate in the markets they are raising funds in an ICO for. Has no
  customers, no revenue, cannot even operate in the markets they are raising
  funds for.

The result:

- The two scam ICOs, already have multiple exchanges lined up to list them,
  with confirmed listing dates
- The actual company with 100 million/year in revenue with actual power grid
  projects, cannot even get a phone call or get the exchanges to talk to them

That is what the altcoin market looks like right now. The non-scams are
actually being filtered out for economic reasons.

What is happening now is:

- The latest generation of users is buying/selling 15 or 60 coins in their
  portfolio. Someone who owns 60 coins does not have 60 wallets installed on
  their computer. Even the altcoin investment fund people are having trouble
  keeping 15 wallets installed to an offline computer and figuring out how to
  do offline transaction signing for them.
- They do not even have wallets installed for ANY of the coins. Meaning all
  of the coins are just sitting on exchanges waiting to be looted
- I did a survey of Ethereum users and ask them questions like "What Ethereum
  Thin Wallet is Best? Is there something like Electrum for Ethereum? What are
  the best Ethereum wallets?" and most of the "Ethereum Users" have never
  actually used an Ethereum wallet or cannot answer, do not know. This means
  all that money is on exchanges somewhere, its not in their wallets.

For the smaller coins (even coins valued in hundreds of millions or billions
of dollars), many actually have almost zero real transactions, zero people
actually with the wallet. I know this from node IP stats and harvested data I
have seen.

Also, for the majority of the coins the volume is fake. There are coins with
very impressive volume (which the exchanges are making a lot of money on) and
very impressive market caps, but its all fake. Just completely fake. To get
enough volume to get on exchanges, you have to agree to pay a market maker to
create volume.

So some coins are giving 3 or 5 million dollars in coins to day trade on the
exchange, to make the exchange owner money and lure in suckers and if you are
an honest coin or not doing that, they won't list you and will complain "Your
volume is not high enough" and to go give their friends free coins to day
trade and make the exchanges a lot of money.

They know the people that will do this and who wont.

The exchanges are making so much money on the scam and scam ICOs, that they
will only list scam coins (which they make more money on). Their whole
business is about volume. They can have 10 million/day in "volume" and the
real order book depth is ten Bitcoin.

Also, most (the most popular) "Bitcoin News" websites are publishing fake
news, "China Bans Bitcoin for the fifth time", "Russia Bans Bitcoin". Then
when exchanges shut down something actualy happens (an event) there are ZERO
articles about it on those website, because the REAL NEWS is not timed to
their market pump and dumps. The media sites are literally just doing timed
market pump and dumps with completely fake news. They are even recirculating
fake, leaked "regulatory letters" from four years ago as "Just released China
banned Bitcoin" news. And every single day is either a "pump day" or a "dump
day".

So for 90% of these projects, unless you are an insider and the one rigging
the markets and in the cartel, you are not going to benefit from buying any of
these coins. They have already appreciated 100x before you will even see them
on the market. They are just popping into the top 20 out of no where now, with
no one in public able to buy anything before the peak and then immediately
crash afterward.

There are almost 0 (ZERO) news websites tracking:

- Actual technology
- Real world usage of blockchain
- Real world development (projects with developers)
- Smaller projects that are trying to do something more than run a pump and
  dump for the suckers

The whole market has been taken over completely. The libertarian aspiration of
Bitcoin have been killed by simple greed and lust after easy money.

---

There are people who have real data (primary data) and they know which coins
have actual users and real user communities. I track this data constantly and
the data is pretty bad. The existing coin market is a train wreck.

Since no one ever withdraws coins from the exchange, the data suggests that
many coins are selling more coins than actually exist. The trading volume and
activity is completely uncorrelated to any real verifiable primary metrics.

People have told me that some exchanges have a history of sudden delisting of
some coins without allowing the users to withdrawal. Which would explain what
is happening. My attitude now is "If the coins are not in my wallet and on my
computer, they do not exist".

Once the regulators lock out the smaller coins from the markets completely
with white-listing, the only thing that is getting listed will be two or three
multi-billion dollar mega-scams a month. I have no idea what this will look
like. Only the biggest, most toxic, best dressed scams who paid off the most
people will be able to get listed.

The big changes to the market will be:

- Multi-coin support (cross platform coin/wallet support standards, people
  pulling coins off the exchanges)
- DEX (distributed exchanges), the real and long term money has already moved
  off the exchanges because of the hacking risk.
- Real uses of blockchain instead of speculation (actual companies, using
  tokens for real business functions)

However, the sophisticated people are doing very very well. The people who
know what is going on.

Many of the large investors are moving off of the exchanges to OTC.

They are boycotting all the coins with one or two "pre-ICOs" where the
insiders get to buy at 1/100th the price of the public. They are ignoring the
massive ICOs and looking at fundamentals and primary metrics.

It is sort of obvious, to anyone that is not an idiot, that if a coin raised 1
billion dollars in an ICO, that the price is not going to go up 100x (that 100
billion dollars in shucks are going to come along and dump one hundred billion
dollars into the coin so that all the people in the ICO can exit 100x when the
bought it at before the ICO). Especially if the coin is a "Smart Contract
Platform" with no users or applications and not Enron selling a billion
barrels a year of oil for E-coin.

IF:

- A coin raises 1 billion dollars in an ICO
- The coin WILL NOT increase to 100x the ICO price
- To go up 100x, the existing coin holders have to be bough out for 100 billion
- That money has to come from somewhere (where as the vast majority of coins
  only lose money and all of their inflows come from people buying the coin
  for speculation)

So it is obvious that all the best relative returns are in the smaller
projects and not the mega-ICOs.

So all the money is being made by avoiding the mega-ICOs and focusing on
fundamentals.

Where as idiots see "They raised twelve billion dollars in FIVE MINUTES. I
NEED TO MORTGAGE MY HOUSE AND BUY THIS IN CASE IT GOES UP 3x AFTER THE ICO".
Then all the people who bought the coin at 1% of the ICO in the "pre-ICO"
(that you were not invited to), will dump everything at the ICO price as soon
as it hits the market.

This trend of everyone creating twelve bitcoin forks, so they can get free
coins and dump them is also ridiculous.

## New Wallet

Wallet Version 20 is released.

All nodes have been upgraded.

Completely new wallet from scratch. The new wallet is dozens of times faster.

Blockchain syncing is hundreds of times faster and is almost instant now. The
old wallet took 1 second per block to sync. The new wallet syncs a few
thousand blocks in a few seconds.

In future upgrade, all blocks will be treated as immutable data objects in
CXO, so that the blockchain can be downloaded in parallel across all blocks
and all connected peers, using all available bandwidth in parallel with no
constraints on the block ordering.

This will be even faster than Bitcoin's "header first downloads" or the rust
ethereum approach.

## CoinHours

The new wallet (version 20) now shows the "CoinHours", which users earn for
holding Skycoin.

We are working on an exchange for converting and establishing an exchange rate
between CoinHours and Skycoin. Coin Hours are similar to the "Gas" in Ethereum
or coin aging in Bitcoin, but are exchange-tradeable and are a separate
parallel currency in Skycoin.

Coin Hours are used for transaction fees in Skycoin and will also be used for
network resources on Skywire.

Coin Hours may eventually also be used for allocation of distributed
computation resources, storage or bandwidth on SkyLedger and any Skycoin side
changes with embedded CX scripting language.

The future wallet versions will add an API and UI to specify or
split the CoinHour balances in transactions.

If Skycoins are held on an exchange, the coin hours earned will go to the
exchange.

Skycoin CoinHours are also a very important part of the Skycoin CoinJoin
infrastructure for increasing transaction privacy. CoinHours will be posted as
collateral for mixing to prevent participants from backing out of or slowing
down CoinJoin transactions. Skycoin CoinJoin transactions improve the
mathematical guarantee of Skycoin transaction privacy by spending outputs from
multiple wallets in the same transaction. This prevents the most common
deanonymizing attacks in Bitcoin. When fully implemented, this will give
Skycoin a ZeroCoin-level mathematical guarantee of transaction privacy, with
orders of magnitude less complexity and computation overhead than the ZeroCoin
implementation, by eliminating the requirement of the highly complicated
zero-knowledge proof system.

## Skycoin (DEX) Distributed Exchange Support

We are currently designing a hardcoded, 2-factor multi-signature transaction
type with relative time locks for Skycoin. This new transaction type
will enable DEX and atomic swap support across Skycoin and all Skyledger
coins.

We are also evaluating proposals for introducing a third transaction type for
atomic swaps between blockchains. However, we believe that atomic swaps
between blockchains are not mature yet and that the 2-signature multi-sig with
relative time lock is the simpliest/easiest way to implement this.

## Skycoin Projects Position on the Smart Contracts Fad

Skycoin does not have a "Smart Contracting Language". Our blockchain language
is a full programming language suitable for both desktop, server, networked
applications but with all the features required for blockchain embedding.

We believe that "smart contracts" are a fad. In the future when anyone can
publish their own blockchain as easily as creating a word-press blog, it does
not make sense to cram the real world uses of blockchain scripting onto a
third party platform. While we have a programming language, CX, that is
designed for actual applications and real world usage, not "smart contracts"
(as to date we have been unable to find a single real use or application for
smart contracts).

## CX

CX is an extremely strict, statically typed, affordance based (based upon Alan
Kay's COLA architecture),  mathematically deterministic language. CX is
designed to support the whole range of applications from being embedded on
blockchain, to programming for GPU, FPGAs and achieving power saving and
performance on next generation CPU architectures (RISC-V) which have explicit
cache load/store instructions.

We are currently prototyping OpenGL support for CX.

CX also has a new website and programming sandbox.

https://cx.skycoin.net

I want to see people writing video games or a poker app or something on CX
soon. I enjoyed "GameCoin" and we need more experiments in embedding video
games on blockchain like GameCoin.

**The Skycoin bounty program will expand to including incentive for video games
and applications written in CX on the Skycoin platform.**

The Skycoin bounty program will expand to including incentive for video games and applications written in CX on the Skycoin platform.


I like huntercoin because it is a blockchain based MMO and we wanted to build
a language and platform platform to make gaming and communication applications
easy. We did not feel this is even possible with a "smart contracts" language.
Expecially because the most popular  application by user are messaging/
communication, file sharing and gaming applications.

We also wanted to allow developers to prototype business logic and test
applications in CXO (which is like blockchain-lite) before publishing onto a
real blockchain, where making updates/fixing bugs becomes much more
complicated.

Skycoin is also the first platform that will be able to distribute blockchain
state updates globally in less than 300 ms (instead of 15 minutes or 30
seconds) and this is the minimum threshold for "real time" interaction
required for several applications like decentralized poker.

Obviously the issues of waiting +30 seconds between interactions and an
inconsistent block rate impair the user experience. Bitcoin's rate of one
block every 15 minutes makes poker unplayable and Ethereum's rate is still
insufferable for real time applications.

I do not see any real world usage, economics or technological capacities
justifying the billion dollar valuations of these "Smart Contract Platforms".
I think "smart contracts" are already past peak and are in a bubble.

So for us to enable these real applications, required years of technology work
to have a platform that could meet these requirements. Regardless of whatever
the "smart contract platforms" say in their marketing, these applications are
only becoming possible in the next generation. Simply none of the current
generation of platforms has a technical solution to overcome the requirements
for mainstream adaption.

So I am really excited about doing a bounty to have something like HunterCoin
(MMO on blockchain) or some kind of real money rogue-like (e.g. NetHack) built
on top of CX. "Real Money Dwarf Fortress on Blockchain". It will be exciting
to see what people do with this.

## Skycoin Roadmap Finished

The roadmap is on the website now

https://www.skycoin.net/roadmap/

## First Distributed Social Media Platform on Skycoin Platform Launches

The beta test of the first distributed social media application on the Skycoin
platform is ready.

https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/ (scroll down to the BBS section)

BBS is a peer-to-peer replicated social media application, built upon immutable
data structures (CXO) on top of the Skycoin platform.

All database in the Skycoin distributed BBS application is replicated
peer-to-peer using the Skycoin CXO library (previously called Aether). Post
submissions are submitted over a prototype of Sky-messenger, which is Skycoin's
TOX-like standard for machine-to-machine communication between public keys
[(github.com/skycoin/net)](https://github.com/skycoin/net).

Sky-messenger is specifically designed for peer-to-peer machine-to-machine
communication, but also has a human-usable, Wechat-like interface.

## Skycoin OTC Market

Now that the prototype for Sky-messenger is working, we can include an
integrated Skycoin OTC market in the next wallet release.

The new wallet will also eventually include a "Send to Bitcoin address"
function, which should increase Skycoin liquidity.
